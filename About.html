      <p>I’m an aspiring web and app developer, who hopes to build cool websites and apps some day. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in lots of different jobs. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building great websites and apps.</p>
      <p>My past experience include military, social work, and juvenile justice, but my passion has always been, and still is, the web.</p>
